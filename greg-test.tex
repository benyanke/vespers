Now sunset comes, but light shines forth,\\the lamps are lit to pierce
the night.\\Praise Father, Son, and Spirit, God\\Who dwells in the
eternal light.

Worthy are you of endless praise,\\O Son of God, Life-giving
Lord;\\wherefore you are through all the earth\\and in the highest
heav'n adored.

\subsection{Psalmody}\label{psalmody}

\subsubsection{Psalm I --- \emph{Beatus vir qui non
abiit}}\label{psalm-i-beatus-vir-qui-non-abiit}

Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the
ungodly,\\nor stood in the wáy of sínners *\\and hath not sat in the
séat of the scórnful.

2 But his delight is in the láw of the Lórd *\\and in his law will he
exercise himself dáy and night.

3 And he shall be like a tree plánted by the wáter-side *\\that will
bring forth his fruit in dúe séason.

4 His leaf also sháll not wíther *\\and look, whatsoever he doeth, ít
shall prósper.

5 As for the ungodly, it is not só with thém *\\but they are like the
chaff,\\which the wind scattereth away from the fáce of the éarth.

6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stánd in the júdgement
*\\neither the sinners in the congregátion of the ríghteous.

7 But the Lord knoweth the wáy of the ríghteous *\\and the way of the
ungódly shall pérish.

Glory be to the Fáther and to the Són *\\and to the Hóly Spírit

As it was in the beginning is now and éver sháll be *\\world without
énd. Amén

\subsubsection{Psalm II --- \emph{Quare fremuerunt
gentes?}}\label{psalm-ii-quare-fremuerunt-gentes}

WHY do the heathen so furiously ràge togèther? *\\and why do the people
imàgine a vàin thing?

2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take còunsel togèther
*\\against the LORD, and agàinst his Anòinted:

3 Let us break their bònds asùnder, *\\and cast away their còrds from
ùs.

4 He that dwelleth in heaven shall làugh them to scòrn: *\\the Lord
shall hàve them in derìsion.

5 Then shall he speak unto thèm in his wràth, *\\and vex them in his
sòre displèasure:

6 Yet have I sèt my Kìng *\\upon my holy hìll of Sìon.

7 I will rehèarse the decrèe; *\\the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
Son,\\this day have I begòtten thèe.

8 Desire of me, and I shall give thee the nations for thìne inhèritance,
*\\and the utmost parts of the èarth for thy possèssion.

9 Thou shalt bruise them with a ròd of ìron, *\\and break them in pieces
like a pòtter's vèssel.

10 Be wise now therefore, Ò ye kìngs; *\\be instructed, ye that are
jùdges of the èarth.

11 Serve the LÒRD in fèar, *\\and rejoice unto hìm with rèverence.

12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,\\and so ye perish from the right
way,\\if his wrath be kindled, yèa but a lìttle. *\\Blessed are all they
that pùt their trùst in him.

\subsubsection{Psalm III --- \emph{Domine, quid
multiplicati?}}\label{psalm-iii-domine-quid-multiplicati}

LORD, how are they increased that tròuble mè! *\\many are they that rìse
agàinst me.

2 Many one there be that sày of my sòul, *\\There is no help for hìm in
his Gòd.

3 But thou, O LORD, àrt my defènder; *\\thou art my worship, and the
lìfter up of my hèad.

4 I did call upon the LÒRD with my vòice, *\\and he heard me out of his
hòly hìll.

5 I laid me down and slept, and ròse up agàin; *\\for the LÒRD sustàined
me.

6 I will not be afraid for ten thòusands of the pèople, *\\that have set
themselves agàinst me ròund about.

7 Up, LORD, and hèlp me, Ò my God, *\\for thou smitest all mine enemies
upon the cheekbone;\\thou hast broken the tèeth of the ungòdly.

8 Salvation belongeth ùnto the LÒRD; *\\and thy blessing is upòn thy
pèople.

\subsection{Lesson --- Ephesians 2:4-6
(DR)}\label{lesson-ephesians-24-6-dr}

But God, (who is rich in mercy,) for his exceeding charity wherewith he
loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together in
Christ, (by whose grace you are saved,) And hath raised us up together,
and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places, through Christ
Jesus.

\subsection{Evening Canticle --- \emph{Magnificat Anima
Mea}}\label{evening-canticle-magnificat-anima-mea}

My soul doth magnify the Lord, *\\ and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
Savior.\\For he hath regarded *\\ the lowliness of his handmaiden.\\For
behold from henceforth *\\ all generations shall call me blessed.\\For
he that is mighty hath magnified me, *\\ and holy is his Name.\\And his
mercy is on them that fear him *\\ throughout all generations.\\He hath
showed strength with his arm; *\\ he hath scattered the proud in the
imagination of their hearts.\\He hath put down the mighty from their
seat, *\\ and hath exalted the humble and meek.\\He hath filled the
hungry with good things, *\\ and the rich he hath sent empty away.\\He
remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel, *\\ as he promised
to our forefathers,\\ Abraham and his seed for ever.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: * as it was
in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.\\ Amen.

\subsection{Apostles' Creed}\label{apostles-creed}

I believe in God, the Father almighty,\\ maker of heaven and earth;

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord;\\ who was conceived by the
Holy Ghost,\\ born of the Virgin Mary,\\ suffered under Pontius
Pilate,\\ was crucified, dead, and buried.\\ He descended into hell.\\
The third day he rose again from the dead.\\ He ascended into heaven,\\
and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty.\\ From thence
he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost,\\ the holy catholic Church,\\ the communion
of saints,\\ the forgiveness of sins,\\ the resurrection of the body,\\
and the life everlasting. Amen.
